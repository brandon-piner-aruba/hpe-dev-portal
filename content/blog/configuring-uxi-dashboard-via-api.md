We are excited to announce the release of our new API that allows you to configure your UXI dashboard programmatically. This API provides endpoints to manage various aspects of your dashboard configuration. We are also very excited to announce we did not stop at just releasing the API. We have also released a terraform provider which will hopefully allow customers to manage their dashboard configuration in a much easier way!
